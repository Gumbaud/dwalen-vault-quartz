Demons from the Hell plane

There are various subspecies of Hellkin. Some of them are more monster than sophont, here is a loose ranking:

Alldemons -> Very high intellect, incredibly strong, masterful at the arcane
Higher demons -> higher than normal intellect, incredibly strong, magically adept
Lesser demons -> Normal intellect, quite strong
Implings -> Dumb intellect
Grotesques -> Very low intellect, almost animalistic instinct

Demons use their own magical weave. It is very suitable for brute force and dominating minds. 
## Notable demons and other hellkin:

### Anghelaic
`Other names: Anghelaiuc/ Anghelauric`

A demon princeling. Younger and weaker than most of the others. They are sworn and pledged to another and act under them. In a wild gambit to gain more power and fame, they used a weak spot in the interstice to hop over to the world of Dwalen, taking a small army with them. 
Once in Dwalen they laid siege to Vod Duresh, but the demonic army underwent the same fate as all others that tried to attack Vod Duresh. Under magic fire, they were destroyed and routed. Anghelaic lost one of their lieutenants as well. 

### Voknotesh
`lieutenant under Anghelaic`

A higher demon that serves under Anghelaic. They are Angelaic's strongest lieutenant. First to hop over to Dwalen and lead the way for their lord. 

### Assassanasas
`lieutenant under Anghelaic`

Strongest lieutenant after Voknotesh. They are a master tactician.

### Ucnotox
`lieutenant under Anghelaic`

Weakest lieutenant under Angelaic. During the battle for Vod Duresh, Anghelaic used Ucnotox as a soul sacrifice to generate a spell bomb strong enough to breach the central gatehouse, making a breach for Voknotesh to sally through. It was all in vain though, as Voknotesh would be pushed back out by a Dureshi paladin of Light and a Southern Sand blade. 

### Obstrox
`Higher demon, possibly an Alldemon`

Obstrox is the demonic lord that Anghelaic serves. Their form is too strong to be able to pass through the weak spots in the interstice, even the big one that Anghelaic and their army passed through. The best they can do is partially exist, and manipulate the world that way. Usually this is done to let Obstrox use their incredibly powerful mind domination magic, to enthrall mortals from Dwalen, and conquer them for their cause. 

*A higher demon that often is in contact with Anghelaic through blood ritual. Obstox is still on the demonic realm. The superior of Anghelaic. They are much stronger, so there is a bigger opening in the interstice needed for them to cross over. By using temporary wells that make the interstice fuse with two other realsm, Obstrox can partially inhabit a space in our world. They can then use a fraction of their might. Usually this is done to reprogram a mortal on our realm by the incredibly powerful mind domination magic of Obstrox. Entrhalling the mortal entirely.*

Obstrox is one of the greather threats defined by the Whispers of The Guild.

Obstrox is in contact with Ur, willing to help Ur reach and influence Dwalen in trade for more power. Obstrox is one of the major players in the power games in the demonic realm. A high prince, that has a bid on the Demonic Throne.
