**STORY**: FMC or somebody else has Prophecy like powers, A prophecy reaches her about the oncomming doom for merea from the Urists. But she also sees a sliver of hope. MMC. So she goes out to meet them. perhaps this is why the boars are where the MMC is fighting off the Wyldekin for the 
common folk being attacked by them on the border. 
No! I will not be swayed by your silver tongue work!


**Quote** by some badass: It is not up to you or me to judge that. It is something between them and their god. But I can arrange for them to meet their god. And that is exactly what I am going to do


the order identifies with a sort of flower. purple perhaps, MCs youngest sister remembers seeing this flower on the MASTER that bought MC. and when he meets her again, at the end of her life, she has been telling people to look out for the strange flower
as the flower does not grow in Merea

novel 1 should end with a strong magical energy surge, somewhere distant, very distant, but extremely powerfulelise

MC kneels down and starts to cry. When Valens and sis ask what is the matter he says this means his master has failed his quest and is probablt dead

idea: some old mage is encased in keepstone, but a very clear trasnparant variant. A myth exists around them. The man frozen in glass at the bottom of the lake. 



Durym are short and stocky build. Suited for being walking fortresses, fighting hordes of stone folk.

wyld folk are tribal and shamanistic. They live in close harmony with nature and the spyrits. They have odd views on decency, death, and how to live life. They see clothing more as protection for when they need it, and have no issues with being naked. 

Vod Durym/ Duresh was once a gateway city. Meaning it is connected to a vast tunnel system that traverses through the thick of the diskworld. ending up on the other side. The city on the other side possibly fell, in any case, in between them now sit the stone folk. So they are cut off from the other side.

At the core of Phrysia reside the Ur cultists. They offered so many in his name, that there is os much sacrifical energy, that cant go anywhere because of the blockade that the other gods put up. that it pools there, the air thick with the energy.
This allowed Ur to reach Dwalen via other ways, the demonic plane. allowing him to talk to his followers, increase magical artefacts that allowed him to appear more easy. Eventually coming over entirely while inhabiting a demon body, only for a few moment.
The divine power is so thick that lesser, higher dimensional beings seep through tiny cracks, along with demons. The Urists use these in their army



big, rideable pigs for Dwalen
They are huge, sturdy, loyal and intelligent

Duri <> Duresh
Duri = the species
Duresh = other species that joined the Durim
Durim = collective term


Anari where once the Elfin, Elves, blessed by their God
But after the corruption, they became the Anari, the fallen in their tongue
Malformed by divine curses



Akhalonia knew of the coming attack from Phrysia, so they prepared and grew stronger. Strong enough that Phrysia would have called off theur

THe tower lords of Phrysia. The gigantic towers were a different approach to survive the cataclysm. Instead of building gigantic fortress cities high up against mountains, they build huge towers in which to hole up in.




wifwolf -> female werewolf


Some entitities can split themselves up in lesser entitities that then are a hive mind. They can gather into one again as well. to become extremely stron g beings. We need a species based on this.


Duri use anari weapons. Anari weapons are so enchanted that they easily cut throught he stone folk things
-> Anari weapons glow golden yellow

Finn brings encahntment rtech to the Duri via Valens. His weapons are not as good as Anari weapons but good enough to go toe to toe with them. With his tech they can also mass produce them

The Duri have some rudimentary Gunpowder tech and cannons and muskets.

They also have magic fuelled muskets. These are reloaded by charging them with mana. This looks as if magical fog/ smoke from your hand is moved into the chamber.

Quant comes from Durim, so he has access to both a magical musket as powder musket. He also has knowledge of the stone folk and recognises them when they meet them in the Wylde.

cat folk
different races in species

villages and towns in the periphery always have watches in the night
For wildfolk or monsters or bandits or worse ...


MC Dwalen is evry skilled in actual combat. Learned to wield his weapons while also keeping his movement up, never getting surrounded because he trained in the Wyld


saying: to piss in GODNAME's cup


winter berries

conan 8 as inspi


a band of free lances -> mercenaris


the red brotherhood



idea for cultural myth around death. It is not creepy, it is a kind and warm person guiding you to the next life, possibly motherly aspects to it.



the kingdom of the peninsual to the bottom right is relatively safe. no wyld near them. They are known for their art, wine and fine food. Also great merchantry



the tower lords of vylyth are all cultists of Ur. 
Their huge towers are possible by using magical skeleton pillars inside.
When a new Tower lord is appointed, they take their cultists with them and grow a new skeleton with their Urian magic.
This requirtes a lot of blood and this is usually the reason for them going to war
The war on Akhalon was for this reason. And even though it is considered a loss for Vylyth, they finished their new tower.





magical contemplation - various levels
first it slows your need for food and drink
then it fully negates it

Seels -> money



Some magical entitties in the spirit realm can be so powerful that coming near them, and inspecting the,m in the spirit realm is enough to damage you


Berunds palm
