Blood carries magical energy, and is also an important factor in magical potential to some degree.


Blood is important -> The Duri have been altered once like the Anari have been. Traits of Duri blood where used as a tracker for them
Blood is tied to magic as well.

as a tracker for bringing back the dead. This is not common knowledge
