A collection of loose notes that have to worked further out to decide if they are good enough or not.

Magic pattersn can take up the form of flowers -> indian chakra shit

there exist magical principles, overarching ideas that grant enlightenment
tied to mind levels
tied to martial marts


Aum conversdion principles are base spell components that convert refined Aum into a usable spell energyu. Weaker energy types are easier to convert byt less effective. 


peak magic user is balanced between channeling and spells, can continously channel for overal body increase, and fight while weaving spells.


healing magical spells are called **mendings**. They mend the flesh and soul, lesser mendings are for small wounds or to stabilize and so on and so forth.
Healing magic calls for large amounts of power and energy and needs alchemical substances to aide the process as well.
While healing magic can heal on its own, substances lower the needed energy amounts, which are absurd otherwise

**Curses**
-> spells that have some degree of reflection and automation. They keep iterating over itself, corrupting and transforming living matter. 



mental maghics, you move you7r mind through another mind, conquering it like that. it is abstract byt can be seen as moving through as well and stuff

his mind moved through hers, she couild feel him conquer part after part


ancient roads where magitech that fueled magic robots and carsd as they traveresed over it

until one opens their mind they are protected by a strong natural force. it is lamost impenetrable by most magi
but once one creates their mind fortrtess and opens their mind to the mental realm, they become vuirrnerab;e and need to make their own deencces
the benefit of this is that magi can start to make spells with their projected self, eventually leanring to work with their corporeal form and their incorporeal form at the same time
this takes practice though and is usually reserved for higher end thrid levels

when projecten self gets shattered, it is akin to losing consciousness and it takes a while to regain it





Soul flame. A magical fire that only affects the soul and Aurem. You can not see it burn in the mortal realm but can see it in the mind realm. If left to burn it will destroy the soul and aurem of a person, but it can be controlled to cause great pain
an effective way of torture

Aurem can be used to sense more of the surroundings. A mix of sensing the mind realm as well as Aum traces in the mortal realm give more feedback of the surroundings. This requires a higher mind cultivation to process tho

parallel minds

Using Y instead of I is done when we talk about things of a magical nature, or that are influenced by magic. Examples: Vampyr, Wyld, Goblyn, Aurym, ...

Magic can be used to enchant items. Enchanting items works best on strict geometric forms. Squares, circles, rectangles, triangles. 
Each geometric form is best used for a single enchantment. But multiple forms can be combined in one item, and allowed to work together if the enchanter has enough skill. Eg an amulet made out of a circle and several triangles could have multiple enchantments working together. 
For this reason, swords are often rectangular in shape if they are meant to be enchanted. 
legendary artefact -> sword made out of tiny triangles, fitted together. all enchanted -> This is also how Godlike avatar weapons where made, but with even smaller and more triangles. As enchanting does not require a large space in the corporeal. 


IDEA: Magic that is mentally cast has to be written still. Only now the Mental/ mind eye form of the user is writing the spell in the Mental realm. In their mind fortress, or outside of it, depending on if it has to be externally or not. 
Mental realm is fluid. The projection can choose to exist in the mind fortress, or outside of it in the mental realm.

magic channeling can have different effects and efficiencies depending on how it is circulated through the nervures

examples: https://manga-demon.org/manga/The-Archmage-Transcending-Through-Regression/chapter/13-VA37

raw casting: exhuming pure magical enmergy without refining it hrough spellcraft

concord

spiritualists are incredibly strong. they are people who merge with spirtis, asfter making a contract with them. this usually costs them a lot, usually in terms of soul or life, but yeilds incredible powers. some spiritualists subdue spirits instead of making dealsd with them.
