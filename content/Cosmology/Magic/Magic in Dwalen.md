> Magic in Dwalen has gone through a whole evolution over the ages. Here we will be talking mainly about the system that is called the Second Weave. For info and history about the First Weave and the evolution of magic in Dwalen, you can go to [[History of Magic in Dwalen]].

Magic in Dwalen is often called the Second Weave. Why it is exactly called the second weave, is something that is lost to history. It is called a weave because creating spells with the arcane glyphs is called weaving the arcane.

The Second Weave is a complex and layered magical system. It can also be divided up into different schools or flows. In the current world, these are often seen as disciplines that stand alone. But to reach the top the arcane arts, one needs to learn and master all of them, and unlock the synergies between them.

Magical energy, often called Aum | Aumeric | Aurem, may look like a simple energetic force at first, but is more complex and layered as well.

The various ways that the Second Weave interacts with a mage's body, and the world, are complex and extensive too.

Because of this, each informational cluster will get its own page, to really dive deep into the fine details. They are ordered in a somewhat logical sequence, starting from the fundamentals and working up from there. In each separate note you will find a link back to here, and a link to the next note in the ordered list. The full list can be found below for ease of use. We call this the Arcaneum.
