Dwalen's magical history starts in the very early days, after the Golden Pod landed on Dwalen. With the Golden Pod came the Seeds. Strong psionics of the golden empire, that had now been gone for over two millennia. After setting up the infrastructure to check if a new imperium spanning the stars would be possible or not, and finding out there where still strong disturbances in the Drullavid and the everessence, they despaired. But only for a moment. Then they got to work. Building a new empire on Dwalen. Uplifting and guiding the existing species. A golden age started on Dwalen, all build on the principles of Psionic mastery. But no matter their effort, by the time they died, the Golden Seeds had only been able to pass over a tiny amount of Psionic mastery to their pupils. And even though they tried to impress the importance of the history of the Golden Empire, and how to check for the disturbances, mundane life quickly gained priority over this message of a world none of their disciples ever had known.

The disciples soon banded together in schools, based on the primary teachings of their specific Golden Seeds. And as with all things, soon divergent faction arose, and war came to disrupt the golden Age. It was a short but tumultuous era, after which the Psionic age came. Gone where the principles of pure equality that the Golden Seeds had prophesized. And now Psionics where the supreme rulers of all. Benevolent often, but despots nonetheless. Under their guidance, Dwalen knew a truly amazing time. For a few hundred years.

But soon they noticed that Psionics were born less often. Increasingly so, until no new born Psionics came around. Masters found no new pupils, and although this was seen as alarming, it gained little attention at first. Psionics lived long lives after all, in the hundred of years. Some Golden Seeds had reached ages of over a thousand years even. Whatever it was that caused this lull in Psionic abled babies, surely somebody of the elite would come around and fix it. But they did not. Other issues where always more important.

And then the first disciple died of old age. And suddenly the problem became a bigger issue. The whole society of Dwalen was based on Psionics. Every aspect of daily life was dependent in some way on a Psionic doing their job. Now that the first generation of Dwalen born Psionics was starting to die, it meant there was a finite and exhausting supply of them. Many of the great Psionic minds came together to tackle the issue. And many still believed it would soon be solved. And this panic, if it even could be called that at this point, would be over soon.

It is worth noting that Psionic society was very research oriented. Psionics had a certain set of tasks they had to perform weekly, these were tasks that would ensure that society kept working. From sewage plants to mechanisms that kept cities floating in the skies. Low tier Psionics performed menial jobs, while the higher tiers had to take up more difficult and intense jobs. Their research always prioritized their agendas, as it was their way of getting better and stronger. Psionics rarely came across an issue that they could not solve, so this explains their stance towards this problem. Even though it was actually a sever issue.

Three of the greatest started working, and found no solution. So more Psionics where assigned to the problem. But no matter how many delved into it, a solution was not found. Until finally, some of the original disciples started to cross reference the research with old texts from the Seeds, and found that this too was an effect of the disturbances that the Seeds where waiting for to pass. An icy realization came over the world. Psionics would one day all die out. And civilization would crumble.

Some accepted this, and leaned only on their own research. Others started to experiment with ways to keep Psionic automatons to keep function long after they where gone. Other still where researching ways to let normal folk operate the complex machinery someway. Many ideas came and went, and Psionics slowly died out. And soon the day came that the last of the Disciples died. The cut between the Golden Seeds and the Dwalen based Psionics forever cut off. 

A few decades later, the theory of Ascension started to emerge, and gained more and more traction. Many of the best started to experiment with it, and not much later the first successful Ascensions occurred. And with them, the firs half ascensions and miscensions. Disaster and devastation came with failed ascensions. And regulations had to be made. But they had little effect. Those who could manage starting an Ascension where not the type of Psionics that could be ruled by regulations. And while this is where many spirits where born, in their new born state, they where volatile and weak, and made little appearances. 

Aside of the ascensions, another union started to gain traction. These where the builders of the Nexus. They had decided that the only way for civilization to survive, is if they had access to a system that at least could do some things of what Psionics could. So they started building the Second Weave. Psionics where often called the Weave, where they wove reality in new forms by their minds. The second weave would do something similar. But without Psionic attuned minds, they would need a new medium through which to alter reality and weave it into new forms. This would be a whole new magical system, using an extensive and intricate set of symbols and glyphs, while also using as much of the mortal magical organs. So that if there came a day in which Psionic attuned minds would be born again. Magical genetics would still be around.

It was a grand undertaking, and many Psionics flocked to them, as they saw it as their duty to help. Their creation in the end was the Nexus. A multi dimensional structure that would keep all the Psionics inside of it, and create a complex watch system, where a Psionic would act as a vessel through which all magical spellcraft would pass, and get turned into Psionic magic. An interface of sorts. The Nexus would cycle through a Psionic every 100 years, give or take. And While the other Psionics slept, they would remain in stasis. This, combined with the long lives of Psionics meant that the Nexus would be able to exist for an incredible long time. Hopefully, Psionics would be born again before the end of its life. And if they did, the Nexus would be smart enough to detect it,  and eject some of its Psionics, so they can guide the new generations.

It was the ultimate sacrifice of the old generation, to give a chance to the future ones. And it worked. Society still fell but it would have been hundreds of times worse, had the Nexus not been made, and had a select few Psionics not spent their remaining days training as many mortals in the new arcane arts as possible, while keeping things running in a smaller empire for as long as they could.

This was the birth, of the current magical system that is in use in Dwalen, and all its intricacies.
