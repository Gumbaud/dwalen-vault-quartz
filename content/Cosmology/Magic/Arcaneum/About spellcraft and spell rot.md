Explain spell craft, the making of spells.
paper vs projected in the interstice

spells have very limited range to effect. THis is why ranged spells are common place. If you want to vchange the arth or things like it, you need to be close by and touch it. It takes a very high cultivation of mind projection to cause effect further away from ones corporeal body.

what is it
how does it occur
how is it treated
what happens when it is not treated or accumalates too fast
