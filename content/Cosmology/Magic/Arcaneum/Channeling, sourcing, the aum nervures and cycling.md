Explain what Channeling is and why it is sometimes called sourcing as well.
Explain the aum nervures in the body
Explain what Cycling is and why it is beneficial to magi and non magi alike. (cleansing of the nervures. Much like undoing spell rot)
Explain overloading - pushing too far and burning through your nervures. The scars they leave behind, and how they can permanently damage one's nervures, and prevent them from using magic at all.


Channeling -> Training can lead to: 
* better nervures -> Better nervures means your ability to absorb ambient Aum into your nervures increases as well, because your Aum receptors (Small lymph like nodes that branch out from your nervures like pores, they sit under the skin and absorb ambient Aum that clings to the skin) grow bigger thanks to the more often Aum circulation through your nervure system. 
* Healthier receptors -> More sensitive receptors -> Better at detecting Aum in the corporeal world. You become better at sensing ambient Aum, as well as external Aum of other magi (cast spells, channeling, ...).
