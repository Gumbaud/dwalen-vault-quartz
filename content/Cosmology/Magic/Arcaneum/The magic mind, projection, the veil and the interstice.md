Explain what the magical mind is like, what it can do and such
Explain projecting the mind into the interstice, and creating a ethereal body there.
Explain the veil that separates the mundane/ corporeal world from the incorporeal realm of the interstice.
Explain the various 'levels' of the interstice. Upper layer - world layer - shadow layer - deep layer - the forlorn
-> High interstice, low interstrice
-> Low interstice is the layer of the interstice that is closely fused/ attached to the corporeal world/ realm. Beings encountered here will be tied to your world/ realm. Other magi, ghosts, ...
-> High interstice is more a realm of its own. The binding/ filling substance between the other dimensions/ realms. Beings encountered here can be anything, really.
	-> It is assumed that the Cataclysm that ended the Golden empire was an after effect of a multi-planar being moving through a space that lays even higher than the high interstice. Sending shockwaves of passing through the lower levels, which then had ramifications on all realms connected to it. Such as the end of FTL travel in the Golden empire (which moved through the higher echolons of the interstice probably) and no Psionics being born anymore during the Golden Seed days.


explain the various masteries/ levels of a magic mind mastery.
Projecting
perfecting the interstitial body
expanding awareness in the interstice
moving projected body
creating a mind's castle in the interstice
perfecting mind's castle and creating a 'own space' in the interstice
attacking other projected bodies
learning how to break mind castles
learning how to break owned spaces in the interstice



Projecting -> Training can lead to: 
* Better detection of ambient and external Aum in the interstice. You will become better at detecting the Aum traces others leave behind.
* Better detection of other's projections in the interstice
* Stronger projection -> Harder to attack you. Harder to break you. Harder to overpower you.
* Stronger first ward -> your mind castle and projected root are safer. It becomes harder for others to enter it, or interact with it, without your blessing to do so.

At first, the Aumic mind is closed off from the interstice. A natural barrier. To keep the person and their mind safe. But to advance in the arcane, an apprentice mage has to open up their mind, to be able to see the interstice, expand their mind, and project themselves.

After opening, their mind is wide open. Nature's wall gone. So the next step is to stabilize, refine and enhance their magical mind. So they can close it off. This time by will and intent, instead of by nature.

Not all apprentices are able to do this, especially not without the proper guidance. Not being able to close one's mind off again, will leave them easily detectable to other magi. And it leaves their mind bare and vulnerable to even the weakest of mental attacks.
