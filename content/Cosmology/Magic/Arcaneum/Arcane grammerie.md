Explain what grammerie is about
efficiency in making spells
synergies
compartmentalization of spells
reuse of spells

certain grammar routines/ families/ blocks tend to fall in a group. For example, healing spells will fall in a certain type of grammarie that is similar.

Grammerie's core use is to add refinement to spell casting. Grammerie can be, and should be, used to make spells very precise, exact, detailed and finetuned. The more detailed, or concrete, the grammerie is, the easier it is for the NEXUS, to weave the spell. And as such, the less energy the spell will cost to be cast. 
The inverse is also true. The more general, or abstract, the grammerie is, the harder it is for the NEXUS to weave the spell and the more energy it will cost to cast the spell.
Spell rot often scales in the same manner, but not always, as it has to do with how much energy is wasted by the grammerie as well. A lot of grammerie does not equal little energy waster per say. Grammerie has to be balanced as well as intricate.
In a way, Grammerie can be seen as prose and poetry.
