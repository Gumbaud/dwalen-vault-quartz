One of the two Lover gods


Kvilt and [[Usiri]] where among the first Ascended. While a lot of the Ascended started to get bored of being in Heaven as there was little to do to entertain their mortal minds, Kvilt and Usiri trained and cultivated and experimented. 

After a while, they had a break through and learned how to cultivate not their mortal spirit, but their divine spirit. Allowing them to progress much faster than the other Ascended that relied heavily on Prayer and Worship energy from the mortal realm.

After a while, as they saw how the competitive race between the Ascended for mortal prayers started to make them more and more vile, they erected the Great Divider. 

Ur and his ilk were especially angered by this, they had been making leaps forwards by capitalizing on sacrificial worship energy. They attacked the couple together. To the surprise of all Ascended, Kvilt and Usiri dealth with them swiftly. Utterly crushing them. They told them, and all of the Ascended, that all they needed to do was train and cultivate, that there were more breakthrough to be had. And that if they were bored, they should train so they could leave Heaven. For the unexplored dangers that existed outside of it.

After that, the couple left Heaven. Only to return much, much later when Ur was becoming a great threat once again.
