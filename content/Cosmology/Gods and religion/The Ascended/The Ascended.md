#divinity 

Ascension was a long, intricate and complex magical ritual that came into being during the height of the Psionic ages. Magi, who wielded magic by mere thought back then, found a way to transcend their mundane and mortal forms. To stitch their souls to divine flesh, and ascend to a higher plane of existence. Reaching Divinity. 

The ritual required a lot of energy, resources and knowledge. It was limited to the best of the best, purely because of the skill ceiling. This caused a lot of the best psionic magi to leave the world, in a time when they were needed most. ([[The age of Ascension]])
