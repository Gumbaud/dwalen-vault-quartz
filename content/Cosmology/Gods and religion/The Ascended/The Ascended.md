#divinity 

Ascension was a long, intricate and complex magical ritual that came into being during the height of the Psionic ages. Magi, who wielded magic by mere thought back then, found a way to transcend their mundane and mortal forms. To stitch their souls to divine flesh, and ascend to a higher plane of existence. Reaching Divinity. 

The ritual required a lot of energy, resources and knowledge. It was limited to the best of the best, purely because of the skill ceiling. This caused a lot of the best psionic magi to leave the world, in a time when they were needed most. ([[The age of Ascension]])

The Great Divider
The great Divider is a higher dimensional construct created by Kvilt and Usiri, just before they left Heaven. 
The Ascended's hunger for prayer and worship energy had become problematic. Causing rivalry between them, and causing harm to the Mortal realm. Sickened by this, The lover Gods erected the Divider, preventing the Ascended from reaching out to the Mortal realm.

The Divider functions as a multi-dimensional, multi-planar, dynamic, live maze. It injects itself metaphysically between Heaven and the Mortal realm, making it so that anybody that wants to transfer between them, has to pass through the Divider. It was created after Kvilt and Usiri ignited their respective sparks of Null weave and All weave, the energies belonging to the Void father and All Mother. Using that, the Divider implements a heightened form of Quantum randomness that is also used to coordinate the uncountable agents of the two cosmic Forces. 
While theoretically the Divider can be traversed to reach through it, the metaphysical distance is so great, spanning over dimensions and planes, that none of the Ascended are able to extend their Ego that far. And so, they are cut off.

Prayer worship still is able to reach them, as it is also a type of Cosmic energy, but without divine interaction or intervention, over the ages, the amounts would dwindle. And with Kvilt and Usiri leaving heaven soon after, none were left that could undo the Divider. 

While most of the Ascended accepted their fate and went to living in Heaven, or cultivating to try and follow behind Kvilt and Usiri, some refused to accept their fate. 

Ur, ever so greedy, started to look for ways to move passed the Divider. He theorized, correctly, that there should be more planes that neighbor the Mortal realm, aside of Heaven. And that those planes themselves would sit next to others. In the infinitely complex makeup of the Cosmic planes and dimensions, there should then be a way for him to reach back to the Mortal realm of Dwalen, through a host of other planes. So he started searching and Mapping. Looking for planes that attached close to the Higher Wilds, close to Heaven, to prevent getting caught in the Higher Wilds by other higher beings. 

NAME TO BE DECIDED BUT FOR NOW Zed was another Ascended. One of the camp of Ur,he set out to try and best the Divider. Ascended mind's and Ego's are akin to thousands upon thousands mortal minds. One of the great irks of Heaven is that it is difficult to entertain such minds. Zed set out to beat the Divider by traversing it. Using the full extent of their mind, they got a rush out of running the maze. Failing more often than succeeding, sometimes at the cost of some of their power, they reveled in the feeling when they did manage to penetrate the Divider. 
Even then, they were still limited in what they could do. Often only taking hold of one of their believers, or those who believe in their creed (something with beggars, pan handlers and swindlers? )
Giving out small deals that often lead to curses. Ruining mortal lives often, just for entertainment. Being barely enough to satisfy their mind as it was mostly preoccupied with running the maze. 



Pereodim would be the first to have a breakthrough after the Lover gods. Managing to find a cultivation that allowed him to grow stronger and not having to rely on Worship energies. He, and all others, would be unable to master one of the two Sparks though. At best being able to detect them. The only reason that Kvilt and Usiri managed to ignite the sparks within themselves was because of a friction between the two Cosmic powers that raged at the moment they broke through. Imprinting their Egos with the Cosmic energies. One for each. 

Much later, Iva and Melio will find a way to retroactively open up their Ego to the Cosmic energies when they find a spot where they rage against each other. Allowing them to ignite their Sparks of them as well.
