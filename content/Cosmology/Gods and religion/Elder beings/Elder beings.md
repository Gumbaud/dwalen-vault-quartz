#divinity #elder-beings 

Higher beings are beings that exist in higher dimensions, and have always done so. Where Ascended forced and carved their own way into Divinity, Elder beings were born into it. They are incredibly powerful and ill understood.

Most of them have no interest in Dwalen or the Ascended, but some of them took note. Intrigued by the 'game' the Ascended played, they tried their own hand at being a God to mortals. Some of them took a liking to it.

Some of the more known Elder beings are the [[Demons]], the [[Angels of Anduul]] or the [[Three minds of Zor Kovul]].
