#divinity #spirits-of-the-land

Spirits of the land are strange beings. They are the end result of an Ascension ritual that did not complete fully, but did not go awry either. They could be seen as half gods. Spirits are immortal beings and dwell in Dwalen. They ride the perfect razor edge of being Divine enough to be immortal, but mundane enough, to be able to exist fully in the mundane plane.

Often, these spirits have forfeited, forgotten or sacrificed part of their personality, their self, and bonded themselves to a certain idea, element or aspect of the world. Molding their entire existence and character to it. Why this happens is even a mystery to the Gods, for any Ascended does not recall a moment in the Ascension ritual where they would end up like this. It is accepted as one of the quirks of failed Ascension.

Some examples of spirits could be water or fire spirits. Bound to springs, seas and volcanoes. Depending on their might, they can exert remarkable control over their bound element. Spirits can be incredibly strong but luckily are often lethargic and not interested in mundane desires. Power, dominance, wealth, none of these carry importance to them. Instead, Spirits are often whimsical and childish. With the temperament of a child, they can be quickly swayed with the right boon or offer, but are equally as quickly angered.

# Varia notes on spirits
spirits can have children. These are not really children but an affect of their mind further fracturing due to their existence. These children are small fragments and usually are mini versions of the spirits form and mind
