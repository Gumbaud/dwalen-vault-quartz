#divinity 

Sometimes, an ascension ritual went awry. Not enough power was provided, the mage lacked the required skills or a myriad of other variables could go wrong. The end result then is something altogether different from a God or Spirit of the land. Something best described as a 'thing'. Something that exists, but really should not.

Usually, these 'things' don't last long. Devoured by multidimensional horrors, as a light snack. But the void between planes is large, and some of them live long enough to learn how to survive. Outside of the bounds of heaven, in between the horrors. These become things to fear. For when one lives amongst the horrors in between worlds, one becomes horror.

Worshipping one of these 'Ungods' is inviting sanity into one's mind. They are chaos, they devour, they do not repay. Yet, some folk find their way into worshipping them. These cults luckily do not survive long, for gaining the focus of one such being usually ends in a gruesome death.
