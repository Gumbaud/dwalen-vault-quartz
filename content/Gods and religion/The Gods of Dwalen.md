#divinity 

Dwalen has known many Gods over the ages. Some real, some figments of collective imagination. The gods listed here are merely the ones that are still known in the world. Many more have existed, and perhaps still do, but without any real ties left to the world of Dwalen.

Gods can be divided up in the following categories:
- [[The Ascended]] - Mortals that ascended to Godhood
- [[Spirits of the land]] - Higher beings tied to Dwalen
- [[Elder beings]] - Divine beings that have always existed in a higher state of being
- [[Misscended]] - Those that tried to ascend, but failed

The Ascended are the Gods that are worshipped the most in Dwalen, and in a structured framework. The Gods are seen as a pantheon, but depending on culture, following or location, people can worship all of them, see some of them as bad or evil, or see some of them as false Gods entirely. 

Spirits of the land are seen more as mystical forces of nature. They are rather respected than worshipped. Being given gifts and ritual thanks in return for favors. Usually worshipped in fringe and border regions.

Elder beings have often little interest in the world of Dwalen. But some of them saw how the Ascended interacted with it, and started to mimic them. When they are worshipped, they are often worshipped in the same manner. But they have far less stakes in the fate of Dwalen than the Ascended do.
