UR is trying to incarnate into Dwalen by having his cultists create demonic wombs that are imbued with shards of his divinity. These shards can then gestate and result in an avatar being born, but it can also fail and result into abominations, hardly controlled. 

Sometimes it fails and results in a sub species of abominations. These have intellect and are called the Urim. They can procreate.

they are considered other planars as they are created with a shard of Ur. which is now an other planar being.
