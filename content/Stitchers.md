The Stitchers are enigmatic beings. They are like the Whispers, more agents of the two primoridal forces in the Universe. 

While the Whispers further the agenda of either the Father or the Mother. The Stitchers serve the Universe as a whole.

Whenever the reality gets damaged in an area. Due to magic, disaster, Void casting or other reasons, the Stitchers come and stitch reality back together. 

While tears between dimensions can occur naturally, the Stitchers are supposed to come and solve these. But with there being so many manual cases of tears due to magic and arcane use, the Stitchers are overworked and minor tears can exists for centuries before a Stitcher comes by to fix it. 

Stitchers see practitioners of the Void weave as their number one enemy, as all use of Void weave tears reality.
