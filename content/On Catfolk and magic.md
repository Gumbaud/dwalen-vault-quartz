The Aerim, as the Catfolk of Aeraemar are often called, are known all over the world for their great talent in the arcane.

Aerim are especially known for their incredible talent for making arcane constructs in the **Interstice**. Their constructs are incredibly complex webbings of spells and the like. This makes them exceptional masters at **enchanting** and creating **wards** and other such arcane constructs.
